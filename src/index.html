                <p class="bio">Welcome to my website! I am a History graduate and aspiring Web Developer based in Bristol, UK.

                    detailing my education and career history; and how to contact me.

            <h1>About</h1>
            <h4>From History to Web Development</h4>
            <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in History from Royal Holloway and a Master's Degree in Byzantine History from the University of Oxford.
                Why, then, am I getting myself into something apparently completely different? Isn't programming for people who have degrees in Computer
                Science or Maths?
            </p>
            <p>It's true! Honestly though, I've always loved working with computers. I can remember getting my first laptop and playing around with commands in the 
                terminal, or creating awful little mods for <i>The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</i>. Its just that cirmcumstances, a few books, and some really great
                history teachers led me to study History. I love History and I don't regret studying it. However, I wanted to apply myself to something just as challenging and 
                creative, but also tapped into that itch I felt when I was a teenager with my first laptop.
            </p>
            <h4>The Journey</h4>
            <p>I started off by watching some videos and following along with some tutorials. It wasn't really for any particular end goal other than learning something new.
                From memory, I did some basic stuff in C#. In developer circles this is known as 'Tutorial hell', where you end up just watching someone and copying their code.
                Thankfully, I only did that for a few days!
            </p>
            <p>I started with <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> - a free and open source curriculum in Web Development. The brilliance behind The 
                Odin Project is its ability allow learners to build independantly. In fact, it forces you to do so: there are several projects to complete and Odin only provides you
                with very basic guidelines - the rest is up to you to complete! This is where the real <em>learning</em> comes in - reading articles/documentation or following tutorials
                doesn't really get you anywhere. It also gives you an incredible amount of confidence. When you finish something, you can look at it and think, "<em>I</em> made that!"
            </p>
            <h4>Consolidation</h4>
            <p>Web Development and building small projects is great, but you can build a handful of these without having any understanding of how Computers actually work. This is where
                Harvard's <a href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science">CS50x</a> comes in. This free 10 week course gave me an introduction into Computer Science.
                It covers a variety of topics in two languages: C, a low-level and incredibly powerful language; and Python, a high-level and very popular language. The point of CS50 is not
                so much to learn those languages, but to understand concepts such as Memory, Data Structures, and Recursion. I have a soft spot for C - working with pointers really makes me feel
                like I'm getting as close to the hardware as possible... in a digital sense, not a physical one!
            </p>
            <h4>Knowledge</h4>
            <p>The thing I love about Web Developement and programming (or, what I know of it so far!), is that you will never know it all. There's so much to learn, which is both daunting and 
                exciting. It sends sparks to that part of my brain which loves to learn and be creative. 
            </p>
            <p>Below, I've placed the langauges/frameworks/resources I've used and feel relatively confident in. If you click on one, you'll find that I've written a bit about my experience with it 
                and a link to a project which provides a good example of my experience with the language.

            <p><b>Tennis Tournament App</b></p>
            <p>My local tennis club hosts a summer tournament every year, which is spread over several months. Organising it is a bit of an administrative slog,
                so this app plans to resolve that, by allowing players to sign up and enter their scores themselves.
            </p>
            <p>Still very much in the 'planning' stage.</p>
